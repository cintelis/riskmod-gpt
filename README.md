# Riskmod GPT

Riskmod GPT is an AI-powered threat modeling tool that leverages OpenAI's GPT models to generate threat models and attack trees for a given application based on the STRIDE methodology. Users provide application details, such as the application type, authentication methods, and whether the application is internet-facing or processes sensitive data. The GPT model then generates its output based on the provided information.
